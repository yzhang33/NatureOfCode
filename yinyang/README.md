# Ying Yang
I always into exploring the idea of yingyang from dualism. It states that all things in our world are created by yingyang. It is represented as black and white. Many fields in science carried this idea such as binary.

I incorporated this gravitation force p5 code by Dan and created the animation of yingyang. I added two attractors. One is black and the other is white. Then generate some particles only with black or white color. Black particles attracted to black attractor and white attracted to the white attractor. Watching them moving brings me to contemplate in yingyang
